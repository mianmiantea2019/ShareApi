# ShareApi

## Project Overview
ShareApi is a comprehensive API platform designed to provide developers with a robust set of APIs for integration into their applications. This platform serves as a central hub for API management, allowing administrators to onboard and publish APIs, monitor usage statistics, while enabling users to register, access APIs, browse API documentation, and perform online debugging. Additionally, a client SDK is provided to simplify API integration into applications.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can register, log in, and request API access permissions.
- API Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for each API, including detailed descriptions, request/response examples, and usage guidelines.
- Online API Debugging: Users can test APIs online with a user-friendly interface.
- Client SDK: Provides client SDKs in multiple programming languages to simplify API integration into applications.
- Usage Statistics: Track API usage with detailed statistics and analytics.
- Security: Implement security measures such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
- Admin Dashboard: A web interface for administrators to manage APIs and view usage statistics.
- User Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard for users to explore available APIs, request access, and manage their API keys.
